  * The implementation should follow the Figma mock closely.
  * Make improvements to the design where you see fit.
+ Top bar
  * Login and Signup buttons should have a hover state
Sidebar navigation
  * The content should come from a JSON object that is easy for a non-technical person to edit and add new items to.
  * Navigation items should have a hover state and active state
Actual navigation between pages is not required
+ Main content
  * Dive deeper cards should have a hover state
+ Responsiveness
